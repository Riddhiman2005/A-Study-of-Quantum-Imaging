## Abstract ##
This article explores quantum optics, where scientists for over two decades have worked on methods to minimize fluctuations in light measurement using quantum techniques. These approaches decrease quantum noise and create strong connections between light particles. Besides focusing on bright light beams, the article emphasizes images formed by light, captured using tools like CCD cameras. Since light adheres to quantum rules, images inevitably encounter unpredictable "quantum noise," complicating reliable information extraction and precise detail spotting. Researchers have worked within the uncertainty principle to control these changes, achieving "spatial quantum entanglement" that links measurements from different image spots. Such techniques promise enhanced image precision, especially valuable in microscopy and data storage. The article concludes with the potential of quantum ideas in image computing, highlighting early-stage research and practical applications.

## Introduction ##
For over twenty years, scientists have developed methods to minimize or lessen wobbles
in quantum measurements of light. These methods also create strong quantum links
and connections between particles of light. Up until now, efforts to reduce quantum
noise and enhance correlations have mainly been effective when dealing with the overall
brightness of light beams. However, another crucial aspect of optics is the realm of
optical images. These images serve as a powerful way to convey a lot of information at
once. Devices like CCD cameras or detector arrays, which are made up of tiny elements
called pixels, are employed to capture such images. These detectors work whether in
situations where individual photons are counted or when dealing with larger groups of
photons.
Because light follows quantum rules, the information carried by these images unavoidably experiences unpredictable variations known as ”quantum noise” or ”shot
noise.” This noise introduces limitations to how reliably we can extract information
from the image or how precisely we can detect small details within it. In the context
of these optical measurements, the fluctuations that become important are the local
spatial quantum fluctuations. In the past ten years, researchers have explored theoretical possibilities to shape the small fluctuations in light’s spatial properties (within the
limits set by **Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle**). They’ve also demonstrated the
ability to create spatial quantum entanglement, which means generating strong quantum connections between measurements taken at different spots on an optical image.

These quantum techniques have the potential to enhance the precision of measurements taken in images and push optical resolution beyond the typical limits defined by
the wavelength of light. This applies not only to scenarios where individual photons
are counted but also when working with larger beams of light. These innovative techniques could find applications in various fields where light is used for precise physical
measurements, like ultraweak absorption spectroscopy or atomic force microscopy. The
ability to detect details in images that are smaller than the wavelength is particularly
valuable in microscopy, pattern recognition, and optical data storage, where the goal is
to store information on areas much tinier than the square of the wavelength.
Moreover, spatial entanglement brings about entirely new and captivating effects.
For instance, in two-photon imaging, the camera can be lit up by light that never interacted with the object being imaged. Another example is ”**quantum microlithography**,” where quantum entanglement can manipulate matter at a scale smaller than
the wavelength.
Looking ahead, there’s an exciting possibility to extend quantum information techniques to multimode quantum information and computing using images, although this
area is still in its early stages of exploration. This area of study is a relatively new
field within quantum optics, and a handful of pioneering experimental demonstrations
have already taken place. The current research primarily focuses on how to create and
measure spatially entangled non-classical light, along with initial basic applications that
showcase the potential of using these concepts to enhance information retrieval from
images.
To make these somewhat abstract ideas clearer, we’ll now provide a brief overview
of a few accomplishments in this domain. We’ll conclude by mentioning some potential
directions and challenges that hold promise and warrant further investigation in the
future.
