abstract = {We consider the problem of the measurement of very small displacements in the transverse plane of an optical image with a split photodetector. We show that the standard quantum limit for such a measurement, which is equal to the diffraction limit divided by the square root of the number of photons used in the measurement, cannot be overcome by use of ordinary single-mode squeezed light. We give the form of possible multimode nonclassical states of light, enabling us to enhance by orders of magnitude the resolution of such a measurement beyond the standard quantum limit.},

abstract = {The measurement sensitivity of the pointing direction of a laser beam is ultimately limited by the quantum nature of light. To reduce this limit, we have experimentally produced a quantum laser pointer, a beam of light whose direction is measured with a precision greater than that possible for a usual laser beam. The laser pointer is generated by combining three different beams in three orthogonal transverse modes, two of them in a squeezed-vacuum state and one in an intense coherent field. The result provides a demonstration of multichannel spatial squeezing, along with its application to the improvement of beam positioning sensitivity and, more generally, to imaging.}}

We show that both scalar bright solitons and multimode vector solitons experience strong squeezing on the optimal quadrature. For vector solitons, this squeezing is shown to result from an almost perfect anti-correlation between the fluctuations in the two incoherently coupled circular polarizations.}

Quantum images in Degenerate Optical Parametric Oscillators (DOPO) show quadrature squeezing in the near field [1, 2], and Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) correlations in the far field [3]. These effects are due to the generation of entangled photons in the parametric downconversion process within the optical cavity. For a review of these effects we refer the reader to [4,5].",
